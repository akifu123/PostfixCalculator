This C program implemeents a simple postfix calculator.It can evaluate postfix expressions containing numeric operands and basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /).
Key functionalities:

    It reads a postfix expression from the user.
    It uses a stack to process the expression.

    It iterates through the characters in the expression:
        If the character is a digit, it's converted to a number and pushed onto the stack.
        If the character is an operator, it pops two operands from the stack, performs the operation, and pushes the result back onto the stack.
    Finally, it pops the final result from the stack and displays it to the user.

Additional points to consider:

    The code likely includes error handling for invalid expressions (e.g., missing operands, division by zero).
    It might have limitations, such as not supporting negative numbers or more complex operators (exponentiation, modulus).

Overall, this code demonstrates the use of stacks, basic arithmetic operations, and parsing techniques in C to achieve a practical application.
